Python hand detection sends an OSC message to a SuperCollider synth - use hand motions to adjust the synth as it plays!

Python script (using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand and landmarks) sends x and y coordinates of the index finger tip in an Open Sound Control message to SuperCollider. The parallel SuperCollider script uses these as frequency and multiplier for a synth defined within the script. 

Current example is a relatively basic sine oscillator, should work for different synths and for different variables than freq/mul with some adjustments.
