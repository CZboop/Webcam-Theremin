Python hand detection sends an OSC message to a SuperCollider synth - use hand motions to adjust the synth as it plays!

Python script (using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand and landmarks) sends x and y coordinates of the index finger tip in an Open Sound Control message to SuperCollider. The parallel SuperCollider script uses these as frequency and multiplier for a synthesiser defined within it. 

Current example is a basic sine oscillator, but should work for different synths and for variables other than frequency/multiplier with minimal adjustments.

Also detects the hand sign ðŸ¤˜ or ðŸ¤Ÿ (raised index and pinky finger, other fingers lowered) and will distort the synth with randomised frequency, multiplier and amplitude while said hand sign is displayed.

Scripts just need to be run at the same time.
